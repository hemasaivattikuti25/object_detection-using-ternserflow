🎯 Object Detection Using OpenCV and Deep Learning

This project focuses on real-time object detection using pre-trained deep learning models with OpenCV. It demonstrates how to detect and classify objects in images or video streams using efficient and optimized pipelines.

📌 Project Overview

This project includes:
	•	Loading a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., MobileNet-SSD or YOLO).
	•	Running inference on input images or video feeds.
	•	Drawing bounding boxes with confidence scores around detected objects.
	•	Customizing object labels, colors, and detection thresholds.

🧠 Key Features
	•	Real-time detection via webcam or pre-recorded video.
	•	Easy-to-adapt code for different models and datasets.
	•	Clear visualization of bounding boxes and class names.
	•	Lightweight and fast—ideal for real-time applications.

📂 Models and Dataset
	•	Model Used: MobileNet-SSD / YOLOv3 (depending on what was loaded in the notebook).
	•	Pre-trained Weights: Trained on COCO or PASCAL VOC dataset.
	•	Classes: Includes standard objects like person, car, dog, bicycle, etc.

Note: You can switch or retrain models using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenCV’s DNN module.

🧰 Libraries and Tools
	•	Python 🐍
	•	OpenCV (cv2)
	•	NumPy
	•	Pre-trained model weights (.prototxt / .pbtxt / .cfg / .weights)

⚙️ Workflow
	1.	Load Pre-trained Model – Load weights and config files.
	2.	Preprocess Frame – Resize, normalize, and convert to blob.
	3.	Run Detection – Forward pass through the network.
	4.	Draw Output – Show bounding boxes with labels and confidence.
	5.	Display or Save Output – Real-time video or images.
